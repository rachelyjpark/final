      OUR STORY
    </div>

<div class="description">
   Morning Blues' mission is to support and lead a conscious community, while maintaining a destination for health based tourism. We believe in meditation as a powerful tool for positive growth throughout every stage of life. We are a constantly evolving group that dedicates bringing relaxtion and comfort in an eco-friendly setting. To support and progress the meditative community, we offer an array of sessions, workshops, and retreats in various location around the globe. In an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, people all around the world have been quarantined at home which tends to bring stress and tension into people's lives. To compensate, Morning Blues is an event hosted at The Blue Lagoon to promote relaxation and self-care after a stressful year of being in quarantine.</div>
